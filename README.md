# Compliance-Aware Debt Collection Workflow & Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview
Debt Collection Agencies (DCAs) often rely on manual and fragmented processes, which lead to operational inefficiencies, compliance risks, and limited visibility into agent performance. This project presents a Compliance-Aware Debt Collection Workflow & Analytics Dashboard, a web-based MVP designed to digitize debt collection workflows while enforcing compliance rules and providing actionable analytics.

---

## Problem Statement
- Manual case handling increases errors and delays  
- Difficulty in enforcing regulatory compliance consistently  
- Lack of real-time visibility into agent activities  
- Limited analytical insights for performance evaluation  

---

## Proposed Solution
The proposed system is a centralized digital platform that manages debt collection cases, enforces predefined compliance rules, tracks case progress in real time, and generates analytics dashboards for monitoring agent performance and operational efficiency.

---

## Key Features
- Case management using mock data  
- Agent assignment and status updates  
- Rule-based compliance engine  
- Analytics dashboard for performance insights  
- Modular and scalable system design  

---

## System Architecture
The system follows a modular architecture consisting of:
- Frontend for user interaction and dashboards  
- Backend for business logic and API handling  
- Compliance rule engine for regulatory checks  
- Analytics module for data processing  
- Data layer using mock JSON datasets
